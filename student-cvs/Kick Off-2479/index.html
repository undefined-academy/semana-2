                        <h1>Who was Aristotle?</h1>
                        <p>Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist, one of the greatest intellectual figures of Western
                            history. He
                            was the author of a philosophical and scientific system that became the framework and
                            vehicle
                            for both
                            Christian Scholasticism and medieval Islamic philosophy. Even after the intellectual
                            revolutions
                            of the
                            Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment, Aristotelian concepts remained embedded
                            in
                            Western
                            thinking.</p>

                        <h1>What is modern philosophy?</h1>
                        <p>Is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific
                            doctrine or
                            school (and thus should not be confused with Modernism), although there are certain
                            assumptions
                            common
                            to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.

                            The 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern
                            philosophy.
                            How much
                            of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may
                            not
                            have
                            ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these
                            questions will
                            determine the scope of one's use of the term "modern philosophy."</p>

                        <h1>Should we think? / Overthink</h1>
                        <p>There are no ‚Äúshoulds‚Äù when it comes to mindset.

                            I believe the better path is to practice getting out of your head and into your body in the
                            now.

                            Most people miss out on a lot of living because they indulge and overthink their thoughts.

                            I challenge you to try to take a step back from your thoughts and just observe them. Are
                            they
                            positive
                            or negative? Do they make you feel good, bad, bored? Do you obsess on the past or does the
                            past
                            only
                            come up occasionally? How often are your thoughts oriented to your future? Are your future
                            thoughts
                            about success, relationships, your interests? Is the tone of your future positive or
                            negative in
                            your
                            thoughts? Or does your future start out rosy only to be hijacked by doom and gloom when you
                            stop
                            paying
                            attention? What recurring thoughts do you notice? Are the thoughts you observe serving you
                            positively or
                            are they suffocating and oppressive?

                            Above all if you want to change the quality of your thoughts pay attention to your self
                            talk.
                            Are you
                            patient, supportive, or your own best cheer leader? Are you short with yourself, do your
                            thoughts pounce
                            on your missteps, or does your inner dialogue belittle and begrudge the things you do?</p>

                        <h1>What is perspective?</h1>
                        <p>What is the definition of perspective? In general, perspective can refer to a person's
                            outlook or
                            view on
                            something, such as an event, situation, or person. So, what is perspective in literature? By
                            definition,
                            perspective in literature is the narrator's outlook or view on events, characters, and the
                            world. Just
                            as people's perspectives are influenced by a particular set of circumstances in real life,
                            narrators'
                            perspectives are influenced by who they are, what they know, what they have experienced, and
                            so
                            on.
                            Therefore, a narrator's perspective determines how a story is told to the reader.</p>

            <h1>Who was Aristotle?</h1>
            <p>Ancient Greek philosopher and scientist, one of the greatest intellectual figures of Western history. He
                was the author of a philosophical and scientific system that became the framework and vehicle for both
                Christian Scholasticism and medieval Islamic philosophy. Even after the intellectual revolutions of the
                Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment, Aristotelian concepts remained embedded in Western
                thinking.</p>

            <h1>What is in modern philosophy?</h1>
            <p>Is philosophy developed in the modern era and associated with modernity. It is not a specific doctrine or
                school (and thus should not be confused with Modernism), although there are certain assumptions common
                to much of it, which helps to distinguish it from earlier philosophy.

                The 17th and early 20th centuries roughly mark the beginning and the end of modern philosophy. How much
                of the Renaissance should be included is a matter for dispute; likewise modernity may or may not have
                ended in the twentieth century and been replaced by postmodernity. How one decides these questions will
                determine the scope of one's use of the term "modern philosophy."</p>

            <h1>Should we think?</h1>
            <p>There are no “shoulds” when it comes to mindset.

                I believe the better path is to practice getting out of your head and into your body in the now.

                Most people miss out on a lot of living because they indulge and overthink their thoughts.

                I challenge you to try to take a step back from your thoughts and just observe them. Are they positive
                or negative? Do they make you feel good, bad, bored? Do you obsess on the past or does the past only
                come up occasionally? How often are your thoughts oriented to your future? Are your future thoughts
                about success, relationships, your interests? Is the tone of your future positive or negative in your
                thoughts? Or does your future start out rosy only to be hijacked by doom and gloom when you stop paying
                attention? What recurring thoughts do you notice? Are the thoughts you observe serving you positively or
                are they suffocating and oppressive?

                Above all if you want to change the quality of your thoughts pay attention to your self talk. Are you
                patient, supportive, or your own best cheer leader? Are you short with yourself, do your thoughts pounce
                on your missteps, or does your inner dialogue belittle and begrudge the things you do?

                You are not your thoughts, and you can't change your thinking without knowing what it is you are
                thinking to begin with. Most of us are so used to being lost in our thoughts that we have no idea what's
                really going on in our heads. Give yourself some space to notice your thoughts, then you will have a
                better direction for your thoughts to go in.</p>

            <h1>What is perspective?</h1>
            <p>What is the definition of perspective? In general, perspective can refer to a person's outlook or view on
                something, such as an event, situation, or person. So, what is perspective in literature? By definition,
                perspective in literature is the narrator's outlook or view on events, characters, and the world. Just
                as people's perspectives are influenced by a particular set of circumstances in real life, narrators'
                perspectives are influenced by who they are, what they know, what they have experienced, and so on.
                Therefore, a narrator's perspective determines how a story is told to the reader.</p>
